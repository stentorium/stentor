Definition of conditions.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export interface Conditions 
```

## Remarks

A couple of notes on the behavior: \* If passed musts and shoulds, they are ANDed (or &amp;&amp;) together. All musts must pass and at least one should needs to pass. \* If only one shoulds is provided, it must return true for the conditions to be met. \* If multiple shoulds are passed
