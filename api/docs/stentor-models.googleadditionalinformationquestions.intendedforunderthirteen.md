## GoogleAdditionalInformationQuestions.intendedForUnderThirteen property

From the copy of the question:

Are children under the age of 13 one of the intended audiences of your Actions? If yes, you must join the Actions for Families program. The Actions for Families program allows developers to designate that their Actions are family-friendly, so parents and kids can find trusted, high-quality content more easily on the Google Assistant.
